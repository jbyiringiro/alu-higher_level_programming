How to Use 5-text_indentation.py
================================

This module defines a text-indentation function ``text_indentation(text)``.

Usage
=====

Text is printed with 2 new lines after each of the characters ``.``, ``?``,
and ``:``.

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("Hi?")
    Hi?
    <BLANKLINE>

No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("   Hello World.")
    Hello World.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("          ")

Similarly, no spaces are printed at the end of each printed line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("Hi.   ")
    Hi.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("    Hello World.    Learning programming.   ")
    Hello World.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Learning programming.
    <BLANKLINE>

New lines are only printed for the characters ``.``, ``?``, and ``:`` -
text not ending with one of these characters is not ended with a new line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("Hello world, learning programming")
    Hello world, learning programming

New lines within a string are printed as normal.

::

    >>> text_indentation("Hello world! Learning programming:\nPrinted.")
    Hello world! Learning programming:
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    Printed.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("\n\n\n Printing three new lines.")
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    Printing three new lines.
    <BLANKLINE>

::
    >>> text_indentation("Hi \n new line.")
    Hi 
    new line.
    <BLANKLINE>


Invalid Text
============

The parameter ``text`` must be a string. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.

::

    >>> text_indentation(7)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

::

    >>> text_indentation({"one": 1, "two": 2})
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

::

    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string
